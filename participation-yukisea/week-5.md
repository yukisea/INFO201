# Week 5

## Exercises
In this section, you should provide a **bulleted list** of **links** to exercise chapters you worked on this week. At a minimum, we expect to see substantial progress on the exercises discussed in class (remember, you should be pushing commits to the work you are doing in the `book-exercises-USER-NAME/` repository). For each link (chapter), include a brief note about which skills are covered in the exercise (this will be helpful to come back to!). Feel free to link to the entire chapter, or a specific exercise. For example:

- [eviction report](https://github.com/yukisea/eviction-report/blob/gh-pages/analysis.R): compute values and create graphics of interest
- [Chapter 16, exercise 1 ](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-16-exercises/exercise-1/exercise.R): Learned ggplot2 basics
- [Chapter 16, exercise 2](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-16-exercises/exercise-2/exercise.R): Learned ggplot2 practice
- [Chapter 14, exercise 2](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-14-exercises/exercise-2/exercise.R): Learned working with data APIs
- [Chapter 18, exercise 1](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-18-exercises/exercise-1/exercise.R):

## New Skills and Challenges
In this section, describe the new skills you acquired and challenges you encountered. The format is up to you -- feel free to use a list, a table, sub-headers, or any other format you see fit. Identifying concepts that you find difficult can help you round out your skills in a systematic way.

>New skills we learned this week is the basic commands of `ggplot2` such as `geom_line`, `color`, `alpha` and so on. We also learned `R markdown`.
## Specific Code Sections
In this section, add _at least_ 3 code blocks containing code that you found helpful this week. This is your opportunity to keep track of syntax/code skeletons so you can easily come back to them for future use! Make sure to use **code block formatting** and **include comments** with the code. Feel free to also include images, links, or other content that makes this more useful for you!

```r
# ggplot2
# set data
ggplot(data = dt)

# drow liner
geom_line()

# set color
geom(color = "blue")
```

```r
# display top n by a
top_n(n, a)
# use data as date
as.Date(File.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
# separate
separate(location, c(), ",")
```

```r
# set transparency
geom_line(, , alpha = 0.5)
# make a  title
labs(title = "")
```


## Goals for the upcoming week
What are your goals for the upcoming week? Are there any questions that you have that you hope to answer in the coming week?They can be specific and technical (e.g., _practice XX_) or general and more personal (e.g., _work more efficiently on homeworks_). Again, the format here is up to you -- this is also a great place to express your goals and areas of confusion to the TAs so they can provide better support!

> This week, because of snow days, I do not learn much, so I want to know `ggplot` and `R markdown` more deeply.
