# Week 1  

## Exercises
In this section, you should provide a **bulleted list** of **links** to exercise chapters you worked on this week. At a minimum, we expect to see substantial progress on the exercises discussed in class (remember, you should be pushing commits to the work you are doing in the `book-exercises-USER-NAME/` repository). For each link (chapter), include a brief note about which skills are covered in the exercise (this will be helpful to come back to!). Feel free to link to the entire chapter, or a specific exercise. For example:

- [Chapter 2]()
- [Chapter 3, exercise 1](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/tree/master/chapter-03-exercises/exercise-1): Learned syntax for Markdown.
- [Chapter 4, exercise1](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-04-exercises/exercise-1/README.md): Learned links
- [Chapter 4, exercise2](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-yukisea/blob/master/chapter-04-exercises/exercise-2/README.md):learned making table

## New Skills and Challenges
In this section, describe the new skills you acquired and challenges you encountered. The format is up to you -- feel free to use a list, a table, sub-headers, or any other format you see fit. Identifying concepts that you find difficult can help you round out your skills in a systematic way.

I learned basic usage of terminal. It contains how to `move directory`, `open file`, `copy file`, `remove file` and so on.
I also leaned how to `push` for `GitHub`. It requires `add` and `commit`.
## Specific Code Sections
In this section, add _at least_ 3 code blocks containing code that you found helpful this week. This is your opportunity to keep track of syntax/code skeletons so you can easily come back to them for future use! Make sure to use **code block formatting** and **include comments** with the code. Feel free to also include images, links, or other content that makes this more useful for you!

```bash
# confirm current directory
pwd
# move directory
cd
# make directory whose name is ""
mkdir
# see all files or directories which is under this directory
ls
```

```bash
# adding to index from work tree
git add .
# update your file with comment
git commit -m ""
# push to GitHub
git push
```

```md
# This is a header
**bold**
[]() # make a link
```

## Goals for the upcoming week
What are your goals for the upcoming week? Are there any questions that you have that you hope to answer in the coming week?They can be specific and technical (e.g., _practice XX_) or general and more personal (e.g., _work more efficiently on homeworks_). Again, the format here is up to you -- this is also a great place to express your goals and areas of confusion to the TAs so they can provide better support!

> I want to work more efficiently. I want to understand more deeply about terminal and R language!
