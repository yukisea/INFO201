# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

| courses number | courses title| instructor name |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| STAT180       |      Introduction to Data Science |       Werner Stuetzle   |
| INFO201    |     Technical Foundations |    Michael Freeman    |
| JSIS478   |       Special topics |     Lagos    |
