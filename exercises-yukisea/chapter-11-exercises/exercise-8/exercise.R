# Exercise 8: exploring data sets

# Load the `dplyr` library
library("dplyr")

# Read in the data (from `data/pupulitzer-circulation-data.csv`). Remember to 
# not treat strings as factors!
pulitzer <- read.csv("data/pulitzer-circulation-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# View in the data set. Start to understand what the data set contains
View(pulitzer)

# Print out the names of the columns for reference
colnames(pulitzer)

# Use the 'str()' function to also see what types of values are contained in 
# each column (you're looking at the second column after the `:`)
# Did any value type surprise you? Why do you think they are that type?
str(pulitzer)

# Add a column to the data frame called 'Pulitzer.Prize.Change` that contains 
# the difference in the number of times each paper was a winner or finalist 
# (hereafter "winner") during 2004-2014 and during 1990-2003
mutate(pulitzer,
       Pulitzer.Prize.Change =
         Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014 -
         Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..1990.2003
)


# What was the name of the publication that has the most winners between 
# 2004-2014?
filter(pulitzer, max(Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014) ==
         Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014) %>%
  select(Newspaper)


# Which publication with at least 5 winners between 2004-2014 had the biggest
# decrease(negative) in daily circulation numbers?
filter(pulitzer, Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014 >= 5) %>%
  filter(min(Change.in.Daily.Circulation..2004.2013) == Change.in.Daily.Circulation..2004.2013) %>%
  select(Newspaper)

# An important part about being a data scientist is asking questions. 
# Write a question you may be interested in about this data set, and then use  
# dplyr to figure out the answer!
# I am confused about summaraise function..
