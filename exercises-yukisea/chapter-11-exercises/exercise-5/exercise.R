# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>% group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
dep_delay_by_month

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
filter(dep_delay_by_month, delay == max(delay)) %>% select(month)

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows
arr_delay_by_dest <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-arr_delay)
head(arr_delay_by_dest)

# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!
filter(airports, faa == arr_delay_by_dest$dest[1])

# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
city_highest_speed <- flights %>%
  mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(speed == max(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(dest)
city_highest_speed
