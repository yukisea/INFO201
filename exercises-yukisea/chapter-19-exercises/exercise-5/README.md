# Exercise 5
In this exercise, you'll build a simple Shiny application that can communicate between a server and a user-interface. The final product will be a scatterplot in which you can select which columns of the `mpg` dataset to display, and how you want the graph to be rendered (using shiny widgets):

To complete the exercise, you'll need to work in both the `ui.R` and `server.R` files in RStudio, and follow the instructions there.
