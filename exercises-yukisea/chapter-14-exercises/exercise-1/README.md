# Exercise 1
In this exercise, you'll practice reading and querying a Web API. Specifically, you'll be working with the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), which provides programmatic access to information about Github repositories.

You will need to read the documentation at **<https://developer.github.com/v3/>** in order to discover appropriate endpoints, their parameters, and their schemas. (Categories of endpoints are listed on the right, with multiple endpoints described per page).

To complete the exercise, open the `exercise-1/exercise.R` file in RStudio, and follow the instructions there.
